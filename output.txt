The text discusses the full-page cache feature in Oxygen, which is designed to enhance the performance of Hydrogen storefronts by caching responses from the Hydrogen storefront worker. This caching mechanism aims to reduce load times for subsequent visits by serving cached content instead of generating a new response each time.

Key points include:
- **How it works**: Oxygen intercepts incoming requests and checks for cached content. If a valid cached version exists, it is served directly. If the cached version is stale, it is served while a fresh version is generated in the background. If no cached version is found, the Hydrogen storefront worker generates a new response, which is then cached for future use.
- **Caching criteria**: A response is considered cacheable if it meets specific conditions, such as being a response to a GET request, having a 2XX or 3XX status code, and including specific headers like Oxygen-Cache-Control and Vary.
- **Oxygen-Cache-Control header**: This header determines caching behavior, with directives like `public`, `max-age`, `s-maxage`, and `stale-while-revalidate` controlling how long and under what conditions responses can be cached.
- **Vary response header**: This header helps Oxygen determine which request headers should be considered when matching requests to cached responses.
- **Oxygen-Full-Page-Cache header**: This informational header indicates the cache status of a response, with values like `Miss`, `Hit`, `Stale`, and `Uncacheable`.
- **Limitations**: Full-page cache cannot be purged for the current deployment without waiting for it to expire or deploying a new version of the Hydrogen storefront worker. It also has limitations in handling specific cookies and serving cached responses from previous deployments.

The guide emphasizes the importance of ensuring that pages opted into Oxygen's full-page cache can be served consistently, considering the potential issues with server-side personalization and caching.

The text discusses caching strategies for Shopify API data using Hydrogen and Oxygen. Hydrogen and Oxygen offer built-in caching to enhance the performance of Hydrogen storefronts, utilizing the web-standard Cache-Control API. By default, Hydrogen caches Storefront API data automatically when using its built-in API client, but this behavior can be customized or disabled. Customer Account API data is not cached due to its personalized nature.

Hydrogen provides several caching strategies with associated cache control headers and durations:
- **CacheShort()**: public, max-age=1, stale-while-revalidate=9 (10 seconds)
- **CacheLong()**: public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=82800 (1 day)
- **CacheNone()**: no-store (no cache)
- **CacheCustom()**: Define your own cache control header (custom)

The default caching strategy revalidates data after one second and caches it for up to one day (1 public, max-age=1, stale-while-revalidate=86399). Subrequest caching can be configured by passing a cache option with the query.

For custom caching strategies, Hydrogen allows the use of the CacheCustom() function, which accepts options compatible with the Cache-Control API. Some available options include mode, maxAge, staleWhileRevalidate, sMaxAge, and staleIfError.

Hydrogen and Oxygen caching strategies are compatible with the HTTP Header Cache-Control API, with a few exceptions. Notably, the no-cache directive is not supported by Oxygen.

The document titled "Performant data loading with Hydrogen" discusses strategies to improve the performance of data loading in Shopify's Hydrogen framework. Key points include:

1. **Fetch Data in Parallel**: Use `Promise.all` to execute multiple data requests simultaneously, avoiding a "request waterfall" where each request is made sequentially.

2. **Prioritize Critical Data**: Focus on loading critical data first, such as product information, to minimize the Time To First Byte (TTFB). Non-critical data, like reviews, can be deferred and streamed in later.

3. **Optimize the Loading Sequence**: Initiate deferred requests first to ensure all data loads in parallel, even if it seems counterintuitive.

4. **Eliminate Data Dependencies**: Organize third-party data in a way that allows simultaneous queries instead of sequential ones, reducing the need for intermediate lookups.

5. **Separate Critical and Non-Critical Queries**: Split large queries into smaller ones, deferring non-critical content to speed up initial page rendering.

6. **Do Not Over-fetch**: Ensure GraphQL queries only request the necessary fields to avoid unnecessary data processing and increased response times.

7. **Leverage Caching**: Use caching strategies to reduce network delays for future visitors. Hydrogen provides various caching options, including default, no cache, short-term, long-term, and custom strategies.

These practices aim to enhance the speed and efficiency of storefronts, improving the overall customer experience.
